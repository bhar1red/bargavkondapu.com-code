## Society is a strange sanctuary.

A sanctuary where,  
Little birds are not allowed to leave their nest, but expected to fly as they are young.  
Little does the young birds know, their wings have been tied.  
Limitless desires to fly high across, but are confined to fly in limits.  
Desperate to stand out, but compelled to fly with the flock.
