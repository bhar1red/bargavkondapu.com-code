[comment]: # (A note is any quick thought, quote, one-liners or a simple tweet. )

Naruni lopali parunipai drushti parupaga,
Talavanchi kaimodchi sishyudavu neevaithe,
Nee aarthi kadaterchu aacharyudavu neeve…

*If you realize the person within you and become his student, then you are your own guru.
